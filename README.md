# Contributing

- create a new feature branch from the "dev" branch
- modify and/or create new components
- commit and push to new feature branch
- create a pull request to merge your feature branch into dev
- assign someone to review it and merge it in
	- Bug the person until it gets merged in, or find someone new to do it

Note: The "dev" branch will periodically be merged into "master" whenever there is a major release and "dev" has been thoroughly tested
